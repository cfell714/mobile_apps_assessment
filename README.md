Assessment for Mobile Apps class

There are three files in the code: Robot.java, customer.java, order.java.

The code, based around a robot, takes commands from the terminal asking questions about party size, name, etc.
It then asks for the customers orders, if the person wants fries or a hamburger.
The robot goes through as many times as there are people in the party and then after finishing their order,
it gives them the check and goes to the next party.
